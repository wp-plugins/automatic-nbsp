Adds a non-breaking space (&nbsp) for selected words or phrases.

== Description ==

This plugin automatically adds HTML entity `&nbsp;` ( non-breaking space ) for selected words or phrases. E.g. 'Mr. Someone' should be 'Mr.&nbspSomeone'. Works with:

*   posts
*   titles
*   pages
*   custom post types
*   comments
*   widgets

You can create your own list of words/phrases or import our proposals for words.
 
A non-breaking space is particularly important in Polish and Czech languages. In these countries there is the typographic rule, which prohibits the display some conjunctions and prepositions on the end line of text. In other cases, help You control the aesthetics.
