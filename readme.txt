Automatic NBSP adds HTML non-breaking space (&nbsp) in your posts, custom post types and pages.

== Description ==

This plugin automatically adds HTML non-breaking space (&nbsp) in your posts, custom post types and pages. 
In settings of plugin you can add words. Each added word will not be displayed on the end of line in text, but was moved to beginning of next line. 
Automatic NBSP allows You to force the browser to not break the line between certain words or web page elements. E.g. 'Mr. Someone' should be 'Mr.&nbsp;Someone'. 
Non-Breaking Space is particularly important in Polish and Czech languages. In these countries there is a typographic rule, which prohibits the display some conjunctions and prepositions on the end line of text. In other cases, help You control the aesthetics.
